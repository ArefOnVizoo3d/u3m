*.u3m:
    added:
        - dpi x/y
        - physics
        - generic thickness/weight
        - clarifying notes
        - units to width & height
        - side material
        - common preview
        - metadata
        - specification for colorspaces
        - additional notes
        - a recommendation to encrypt your custom section
        - specification on how and when offset & factor are to be applied
        - specification on how to load the different maps
        - specification for repeat modes
        - specification for format of relative paths
        - explicitly defined paths to be posix paths
        - added a clarifying note on duplicate entries
        - added a clarifying note on metadata entries
        - added a type for uuids
        - added a type for relative paths
        - added a regex for paths
        - wording on backward compatibility
        - specified calculations are for normalized values
        - added explanation for constant & texture
        - explanation for texture_and_color.texture.mode
        - color_rgb is now in u3m standard colorspace
        - added texture_and_normal for normals
        - notes to texture_and_normal and texture_and_number that says to ignore colorspaces
        - note on renormalizing normals
        - note on decoding/encoding normals
        - added defaults & ranges to the schema

    changed:
        - allowed access to other companies custom section IF THEY AGREED TO IT
        - fixed UUID4 regex from the one at https://www.regextester.com/93857 to one matching an uuid4 variant1 and the delimiters properly (https://www.regextester.com/?fam=115486)
        - factored parts from texture_and_number into scalar_texture
        - factored parts from texture_and_normal into normal_texture
        - factored parts from texture_and_color into color_texture
        - disabled "null" on texture_and_number
        - disabled "null" on texture_and_normal
        - disabled "null" on texture_and_color
        - replaced texture_and_number with bounded types with default value (e.g. texture_and_number_01_1 for a number from [0, 1] with default value 1)
        - anisotropy_rotation is now in percent (0 == 0°, 1 == 360°) instead of "probably degree"

*.u3ma:
    added:
        - first specification based on zip

won't do:
    - color name (no way to extract properly from colormaps on all supported software, no usefull way to describe a multicolored material e.g. rainbow)
    - scaling factor (not needed, as physical size is known and physical size of avatar should also be known)
