Unified 3D Material

Thank you for coming to the Github Page of U3M and working with us on it during these early stages!

Right now, different vendors output their digital materials either in a proprietary format or embedded directly in their styles. And while various integrations already exist, there is a steady conversion that has to take place, different file types to manage and still a lot of incompatibility. Therefore, the Unified 3D Material is being developed as a bridge between software vendors in the Apparel industry with the goal to replace proprietary material formats with a single openâ€“source format.

Split into three parts, the U3M format manages to be flexible enough to embrace new input as well as manage your personal company data, yet structured enough to provide a reliable visualization. For a more detailed overview, take a look at the Unified3DMaterial Documentation on here.
